Have you ever asked yourselves _how to create a podcast?_
Or _how much does it cost?_ or _would I be able to create one myself?_

This is (will be) a series of technical articles about 
everything involved in producing a podcast,
from recording to publishing.
It will show how Marmita de Redon (a portuguese podcast about 90s and 2000s)
was created and published.

This will mainly answer the following question:
**How do you make a podcast (for free)?**

## How do you make a podcast (for free)?

I asked this question myself.
How does things work, how do you start with an idea, a voice which is recorded and edited, and it is sent to the _cloud_,
and gets magically available on my podcatcher (app from where I listen to my podcasts)?

There are lots of answers to this questions over the internet.
Most of them will tell you about third party (paid) services that will abstract the complexity of the system.
But I'm just too techie to solve my problems that way - I _need_ to know how things work.
And if I happen to know how things work, why not taking advantage of this knowledge and do them myself?

When the idea for this podcast came, I got my hands dirty and now I've decided to share my journey and conclusions, 
so other may get some suggestions on how to do the same. 


## Available alternatives

There are many ways to produce a podcast.
Here is a small comparison chart about some of those options.
