It will show how Marmita de Redon (a portuguese podcast about 90s and 2000s) was created and published.

How does things work, how do you start with an idea, a voice which is recorded and edited, and it is sent to the cloud, and gets magically available on my podcatcher (app from where I listen to my podcasts)?</description></item></channel></rss>
